1:
- Start button -> new Game()
  - Start a new game.

2:
- Grid button -> game.canBuild(), game.canAttack(), game.canMove()
  - Need to know which actions can be taken from that grid (attack/build/move)
  - Respective buttons are enabled.

-- KEY: attack, move, and build buttons are disabled by default, only enabled when a grid is selected

3:
- Attack/build/move button ->  game.attack()/build()/move()

To attack/build/move:
-> Select grid -> button is enabled -> click button -> possible target grids are lit up -> select target grid

4:
- Playing cards.... TBD
